# Hash Table Analysis
This repository contains the final project of the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course (AY 19/20) at the *University of Naples Federico II*.

## Assignment
The aim of the project is to analyze the performance of different kinds of hash tables in term of execution time for different operations (insert, search, delete)

## Project
- [implementation](https://github.com/fabiod20/algorithms-and-data-structures/tree/master/Java) directory contains different kinds of hash tables written in Java.
- [analysis](https://github.com/fabiod20/algorithms-and-data-structures/tree/master/Python) directory contains the analysis of the hash tables performance, performed using **pandas** and **matplotlib**.
